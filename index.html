        <h1>My first console.log project</h1>
        <p>The connsole.log is a thing you can use in your code and what it does is that it checks for any 
            errors in the code and tells you what lines they are on and what is the problem.
        </p>
        <p>The visual studio is a platform where you can write code in.</p>
